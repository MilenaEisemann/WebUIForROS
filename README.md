# WebUIForROS
This repo contains code for a prototypical webbased UI that communicates with ROS and its arangoDB database

PLEASE NOTE: As not all of the code for this project correctly can be shared here (e.g. the database and robot behaviors itself, the docker image) it is not working correctly. Also this project is still in an very early stage of development.
